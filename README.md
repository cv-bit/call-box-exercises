## Exercise 2: Graphic Creation

Go to cadillac.com and choose a vehicle from the vehicles page, and design a 940px x 385px slide. Your slide must include:

1) One or more features/benefits of the vehicle

2) Pricing: there is a current limited-time offer of 0% APR for 36 months through the end of the current year. You'll need to use the website for imagery/assets. Brevity is okay. Use your creativity!

## Exercise 3: JavaScript / Jquery

Please create a simple navigation menu - the layout of the nav is up to you. Include four navigation items: HOME, INVENTORY, ABOUT US, CONTACT. When 'Inventory' is clicked, a dropdown is revealed with the items: NEW, USED, CARS, TRUCKS, SUV'S. Be sure to include adequate user feedback, with CSS transitions, psudo-classes, etc. The navigation must be aesthetically pleasing. Please avoid using CSS frameworks (Bootstrap, Materialize, etc.).
